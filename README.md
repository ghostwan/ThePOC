# ThePOC

This project has two main goals. First, it's a proof-of-concept Android app designed to test and improve geofencing accuracy. It helps developers confirm entry and exit events in geofenced areas by showing a timeline of detected events against real-world movement. Second, it tests the feasibility of developing an Android app with [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) using only prompts. (Occasionally, Cursor used French commit messages because of the French prompts, even when asked to commit in English. üòÖ)

P.S. 1: Initially, I intentionally refrained from specifying any architectural pattern, resulting in a somewhat ad-hoc structure. I intend to address this in a future commit by implementing MVVM and/or a clean architecture.

P.S. 2: I am strictly limiting myself to modifying files, including this README, only when Cursor encounters a deadlock. I will document the time of each manual code modification here.

## Purpose

The main goal of this application is to:
- Test geofencing behavior in various real-world conditions
- Validate the accuracy of entry/exit detections
- Provide developers with insights about geofencing limitations and best practices
- Help improve the reliability of applications using geofencing

## Features

### üéØ Geofencing Analysis
- Create and manage geofenced areas
- Real-time monitoring of entry and exit events
- Configurable geofence parameters (radius, dwell time, etc.)
- Visual representation of geofence boundaries on map

### üìä Event Timeline
- Chronological log of all geofencing events
- Comparison between detected events and actual movements
- Detailed event information (timestamp, location, event type)
- Export capabilities for further analysis

### üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map
- Real-time location tracking
- Visual representation of geofenced areas
- Custom markers for entry/exit events
- Search and add new geofence locations

### üì± Modern UI
- Built with Jetpack Compose
- Material 3 design components
- Intuitive geofence management
- Clear event visualization

## Technical Details

### üìö Core Technologies
- **Geofencing**: Google Play Services Geofencing API
- **Maps**: Google Maps SDK
- **Location**: Google Play Services Location API
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Database**: Room for event logging
- **Build System**: Gradle

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The application follows MVVM pattern with clean architecture:
- **UI Layer**: Compose UI components for map and timeline
- **ViewModel Layer**: Geofence and location event processing
- **Repository Layer**: Event logging and geofence management
- **Service Layer**: Background geofence monitoring

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog or later
- JDK 17 or later
- Google Maps API key
- Firebase project (for deployment)

### Configuration
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghostwan/ThePOC.git
```

2. Create a `local.properties` file in the root directory and add your Google Maps API key:
```properties
MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Build and run the project:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Deployment
Use the automated deployment script to release new versions:
```bash
./tools/deploy.sh
```

The script handles:
- Version number incrementation
- Release build generation
- Firebase App Distribution deployment
